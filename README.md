# Voron Zero Carbon Fiber X (Vorbon X) (Voron Zero Light X V2)

The second release of my custom X axis beam for the Voron 0/0.1 printer.

This mod was designed to provide an easy way to have a lighter X carriage while keeping the same stiffness

## Instructions

### 1. Tap Plate and Ensure Tolerances

Tap the middle 10 linear rail holes for M2

![tapholes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/604735153092165642/1047755970836713492/image.png)

and make sure that you can slide a M3 bolt through the outer 4 holes (2 on either side), if not, drill out with 3mm drill bit. It should be a light interference fit to reduce play between the spacer and the plate.

### 2. Heat Set Inserts

Insert the heat set inserts on both 3d printed spacers as shown in the photos. **Note the curved corners on one side when installing the inserts.**

### 3. Install X Beam

Press together the 3d printed spacer and the beam on both sides. Make sure that the holes line up and the end is as close to flush as possible.

**REPLACES PAGE 71:**
Mount linear rail using M2 bolts. Use the modified rail installation guide

**REPLACES PAGE 72:**
Then insert beam like the default instructions BUT, use M3x16 bolts instead of M3x12.

**REPLACES PAGE 76:**
Then bolt Endstop mount like the default instructions BUT, use a M3x20 bolt instead of M3x16.

### 4. Endstop Adapter

Because the bottom edge of the X beam doesnt exist anymore you need to print this new Adapter and mount it so it lines up with the endstop (use glue or similar).

![Endstopadapter](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/604735153092165642/1048034720266584114/image.png)

For me the hole on the adapter lines up with the second from the right hole on the beam.
